Quick and dirty PHP file listing script

## But...why?
I needed a quick and dirty single-file script that lists files when I just throw it in a directory without messing around with .htaccess and stuff.

## Usage
Throw index.php on any old PHP-enabled webserver in the directory of which you want to list the files. 

## Notes
I'm not a PHP dev by any means. This is just quickly cobbled together from bits and pieces I've found around the net. 
I do not take any responsibility when it comes to security or usage of this script.
It's also far from "correct" when it comes to HTML/CSS conventions.
Basically... "it ain't pretty, but it works well enough".
This is mainly used for internal purposes in my home network. 

# Limitations
Currently only shows files. Directories will show up, but they will probably not work if you click on them, unless your webserver is configured to list directories.
